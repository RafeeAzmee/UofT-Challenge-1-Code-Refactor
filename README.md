**HTML, CSS, and Git Code Refactoring Challenge**

Within this repository you will find a refactored version of the index.html file as well the styles.css file.

The index.html code has been changed into proper symantic HTML formatting as well as addtion of comments to aid the reader.

The styles.css file has been changed into proper symantic CSS formating with the use of CSS selectors.

For reference I will be attaching the old HTML code below:
